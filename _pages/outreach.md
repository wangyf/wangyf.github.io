### <span style="color: red"> Rocket Rules: Earthquake Materials for Children **from SCEC**</span> 

Since 2017, SCEC and the Hero and You Foundation have been working together to create earthquake education and preparedness resources for young children ages 5-9. The foundation, founded by Rick and Bunni Benaron, was inspired in part by Bunni’s mother who as a retired nurse helped neighbors after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The Benaron’s initially created their foundation to recognize other first responders through the donation of large sculptures of a dalmatian fire dog (originally called “R. Hero”) for installation at fire departments, museums, libraries, and children’s hospitals. As of 2020 there are 30 such sculptures across the U.S. El Salvador, and Israel.[Original link to SCEC](https://www.scec.org/article/640)
